NSFW Locomotion for VRChat Avatars is a highly customizable and dynamic movement solution designed to elevate the functionality and immersive experience of adult-themed avatars. Built on the foundation of the renowned "GoGo Loco" system by Franada, this enhanced locomotion framework retains all the core features of GoGo Loco while introducing two versions for lightweight (pose only) or standard (emotes + poses).

## Features
- **GoGo Loco Replacer:** Adds all base GoGo Loco functions, ensuring seamless integration and a familiar user experience.
- **IK Integration:** Full Inverse Kinematics support ensures realistic body positioning and interactions with objects and avatars.
- **Custom Animation Slots:** Easily integrate your own animations or adapt the system to your avatarâ€™s unique requirements.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Enables fluid transition between poses and emotes, enhancing the realism and responsiveness of avatar interactions.
- **Motion Time for Two-Frame Poses:** Utilizes motion time to smoothly float between two frames, enabling subtle actions within the pose, such as spreading legs or shifting body weight.
- **One Click Install:** Simplifies the setup process using VRCfury and our custom editor script, which automatically assigns the NSFW Locomotion prefab to your avatar with a single click.
- **Two Specialized Versions:** 
  - **NSFW Locomotion(Poses Only):** Focuses on pose-based locomotion, providing responsive and fluid movements for avatars in adult-themed environments, while maintaining a lower file size. This version is ideal for creators seeking lightweight, pose-driven interactions.
  - **NSFW Locomotion(Emotes + Poses):** Extends the functionality to include full emotes, dynamic movements, and custom animations alongside the pose features. This version offers a richer interaction experience for users and avatars, perfect for immersive roleplay and interaction in NSFW-themed worlds.
